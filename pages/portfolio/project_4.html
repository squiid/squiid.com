            <article class="smallFontBy08">
                <p>In search of a creative, tech-savvy expert to drive its online presence, NetHope hired Squiid to lead its digital marketing and support business development and operations.  The NetHope team leveraged Squiid’s writing, design and copyediting services for a multitude of projects – from white papers and reports to online content creation and newsletters. Thanks to our strategic online communications, clean marketing materials and well-articulated ghostwriting, the quickly growing social consortium has secured high-profile speaking roles for its executives and directors at World Economic Forum and Clinton Global Initiative. Squiid also ushered in new branding and core marketing materials for NetHope, which are still in use today.</p>

<p>Squiid also held a formative role as vendor manager, venue coordinator and marketing & communications lead at three of NetHope’s annual conferences. Responsibilities included pre-planning as well as on-site coordination for the 200+ attendees, which included international C-suite executives, technology directors and high-level donors. All marketing materials were crafted with special attention to branding, consistency and information architecture.
